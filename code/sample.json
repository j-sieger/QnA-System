The sun has gone down to a point of no return, for today. Play called off. So Indias end score of 224/3 tells you it was all normal, but South Africa actually showed up in the morning. 12/1 to 16/2 to 39/3 which also had Pujara and Kohli back in the changerooms, and it looked like there finally was a contest on the cards. Nope. Rohit Sharma, in this form, isnt allowing it. He started off playing, missing, poking, edging, but in the blink of an eye went to smashing them around like only he can. In the middle of his fun, hes notched up the most sixes by a batsman in a series, EVER, with enough time to stretch the lead further. Ajinkya Rahane was uncharacteristically positive, even out-scoring Rohit at one point. Together, they once again took a keen liking to Dane Peidts gentle offies."}], "title": ""}]}
